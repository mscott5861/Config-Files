    # in pixels.  If the width is omitted but the height is given
    # ("-geometry x2"), the message window expands over the whole screen
    # (dmenu-like).  If width is 0, the window expands to the longest
    # message displayed.  A positive x is measured from the left, a
    # negative from the right side of the screen.  Y is measured from
    # the top and down respectively.
